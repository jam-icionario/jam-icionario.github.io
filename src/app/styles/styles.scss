/*
For Material colors, see https://material.angular.dev/guide/system-variables#colors
It shows and explains the colors:
    -–mat-sys-primary as most commonly used color by components
    -–mat-sys-surface as low-emphasis background color
    -–mat-sys-error to alert the user  
    --mat-sys-outline for borders and dividers
It then shows a LOT of extra colors under "Other available colors".

Explained:
> The general rule of thumb is to apply your chosen color to the element and use the corresponding “mat-sys-on” token for text, icons and other visual elements to ensure proper accessibility and legibility.
> For example: primary button uses –mat-sys-primary as background color and –mat-sys-on-primary as label color.
